## Try it

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python agent.py dev` (runs locally with your mic)

## Why I built this

I'm building [Midway](link), a platform for mid-term rental operators. This agent demonstrates how LiveKit's voice infrastructure could power tenant inquiries - handling the common questions so property managers can focus on qualified leads.
